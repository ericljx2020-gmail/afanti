Our starting point is the inequality \\\\(a(x-1) > x + 1 - 2a\\\\).\\n\\nb. We need to simplify this inequality to make it easier to analyze. This involves removing parentheses and rearranging terms.\\n\\nc. To simplify the inequality, we first remove the parentheses. What does this tell us?\\n\\n### Explanation Two: Remove the parentheses: From \\\\(a(x-1) > x + 1 - 2a\\\\) to \\\\(ax - a > x + 1 - 2a\\\\).\\n\\na. The first step is to distribute \\\\(a\\\\) across \\\\((x-1)\\\\), giving us \\\\(ax - a\\\\).\\n\\nb. This makes the inequality \\\\(ax - a > x + 1 - 2a\\\\).\\n\\nc. Next, we need to rearrange the terms to group the \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(a\\\\) terms separately. So, what should we do next?\\n\\n### Explanation Three: Rearrange terms: From \\\\(ax - a > x + 1 - 2a\\\\) to \\\\(ax - x > 1 - 2a + a\\\\).\\n\\na. We move the \\\\(x\\\\) term from the right side of the inequality to the left by subtracting \\\\(x\\\\).\\n\\nb. This results in \\\\(ax - x > 1 - 2a + a\\\\).\\n\\nc. Now, we need to combine like terms to further simplify the inequality. Please think about how to combine like terms?\\n\\n### Explanation Four: Combine like terms: From \\\\(ax - x > 1 - 2a + a\\\\) to \\\\((a - 1)x > 1 - a\\\\).\\n\\na. We combine the \\\\(a\\\\) terms on the right side (i.e., \\\\(-2a + a\\\\) becomes \\\\(-a\\\\)).\\n\\nb. This simplifies the inequality to \\\\((a - 1)x > 1 - a\\\\).\\n\\nc. Given the solution set for the inequality is \\\\(x < -1\\\\), we need to understand how this affects \\\\(a - 1\\\\). What does this tell us?\\n\\n### Explanation Five: Analyze the solution set: Given \\\\(x < -1\\\\), find implications for \\\\(a\\\\).\\n\\na. Since \\\\(x < -1\\\\), \\\\(x\\\\) is a negative number. \\n\\nb. For \\\\((a - 1)x > 1 - a\\\\) to hold true for all \\\\(x < -1\\\\), the term \\\\((a - 1)\\\\) must be negative (because a negative number times a negative number is positive).\\n\\nc. Therefore, \\\\(a - 1 < 0\\\\). So, what should we do next?\\n\\n### Explanation Six: Derive the range of \\\\(a\\\\): From \\\\(a - 1 < 0\\\\), solve for \\\\(a\\\\).\\n\\na. Solving \\\\(a - 1 < 0\\\\) gives \\\\(a < 1\\\\).\\n\\nb. This tells us that for the inequality \\\\(a(x-1) > x + 1 - 2a\\\\) to have a solution set \\\\(x < -1\\\\), \\\\(a\\\\) must be less than 1.\\n\\nc. The range of values for \\\\(a\\\\) is \\\\(a < 1\\\\). Think about what this result implies for problems involving inequalities and parameters?\", name='Explainer')]}}\n",

We know the total number of workers being reassigned is 21. If \\\\( x \\\\) is the number of workers transferred to location A and \\\\( y \\\\) is the number of workers transferred to location B, we write:\\n   \\\\[\\n   x + y = 21\\n   \\\\]\\n2. The problem also states that after the reassignment, the number of workers at location A should be \\\\(\\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\) times the number of workers at location B. We can express this as:\\n   \\\\[\\n   35 + x = \\\\frac{3}{2}(19 + y)\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n#### Board Writing Two: Solving the First Equation\\nWe'll start by solving the first equation for \\\\( y \\\\):\\n1. From \\\\( x + y = 21 \\\\), we isolate \\\\( y \\\\):\\n   \\\\[\\n   y = 21 - x\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n#### Board Writing Three: Substituting into the Second Equation\\nNext, we substitute \\\\( y \\\\) from the first equation into the second equation:\\n1. Substitute \\\\( y = 21 - x \\\\) into \\\\( 35 + x = \\\\frac{3}{2}(19 + y) \\\\):\\n   \\\\[\\n   35 + x = \\\\frac{3}{2}(19 + (21 - x))\\n   \\\\]\\n2. Simplify inside the parentheses:\\n   \\\\[\\n   35 + x = \\\\frac{3}{2}(40 - x)\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n#### Board Writing Four: Solving the Simplified Equation\\nNow, we solve the equation step-by-step:\\n1. Distribute \\\\(\\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\) on the right side:\\n   \\\\[\\n   35 + x = 60 - \\\\frac{3}{2}x\\n   \\\\]\\n2. To eliminate the fraction, add \\\\(\\\\frac{3}{2}x\\\\) to both sides:\\n   \\\\[\\n   35 + x + \\\\frac{3}{2}x = 60\\n   \\\\]\\n3. Combine like terms:\\n   \\\\[\\n   35 + \\\\frac{5}{2}x = 60\\n   \\\\]\\n4. Subtract 35 from both sides to isolate the term with \\\\( x \\\\):\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\frac{5}{2}x = 25\\n   \\\\]\\n5.

Our starting point is to understand that both sides of the equation are fractions with a common denominator.\\nb. The goal here is to eliminate the denominators to simplify the equation. This involves multiplying both sides by 3, which is straightforward because it cancels out the denominator on both sides.\\nc. After clearing the denominators, we transition to the next step where we can work with a simpler, linear equation.\\n\\n### Step Two: Clear the denominators\\nMultiplying both sides by 3, we get:\\n\\\\[\\n2x - m = 2 - x\\n\\\\]\\n\\na. We have now transformed the original equation into a simpler linear equation.\\nb. The current step involves understanding how to isolate the variable \\\\(x\\\\). We need to move terms involving \\\\(x\\\\) to one side and constants to the other side.\\nc. What does this tell us about the next step? We need to rearrange and combine like terms to isolate \\\\(x\\\\).\\n\\n### Step Three: Rearrange and combine like terms\\nRearranging the terms, we add \\\\(x\\\\) to both sides:\\n\\\\[\\n2x + x - m = 2\\n\\\\]\\nSimplifying, we get:\\n\\\\[\\n3x - m = 2\\n\\\\]\\n\\na. From the previous step, we see that isolating \\\\(x\\\\) involves combining like terms.\\nb. This involves basic algebraic operations: addition and combining like terms. The potential difficulty lies in ensuring all terms are correctly moved and combined.\\nc. What should we do next? We need to solve for \\\\(x\\\\).\\n\\n### Step Four: Solve for \\\\(x\\\\)\\nAdding \\\\(m\\\\) to both sides to isolate the term with \\\\(x\\\\):\\n\\\\[\\n3x = 2 + m\\n\\\\]\\nDividing both sides by 3:\\n\\\\[\\nx = \\\\frac{2 + m}{3}\\n\\\\]\\n\\na. We have now isolated \\\\(x\\\\) and expressed it in terms of \\\\(m\\\\).\\nb. This step involves straightforward division to solve for \\\\(x\\\\). The key is to apply the operation uniformly to both sides.\\nc. What does this solution tell us about the constraints on \\\\(m\\\\)? \\n\\n### Step Five: Determine the condition for non-negative \\\\(x\\\\)\\nGiven \\\\(x\\\\) must be non-negative:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{2 + m}{3} \\\\geq 0\\n\\\\]\\n\\na.

We recognize that 196 is a perfect square.\\n3. **Result:**\\n   \\\\(\\\\sqrt{196} = 14\\\\) because \\\\(14^2 = 196\\\\).\\n4. **Next Step:**\\n   Think about how this process of identifying perfect squares can be applied to other square root problems.\\n\\n### Step Two: Calculate \\\\(\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{16}{169}}\\\\)\\n1. **Previous Step:**\\n   From the previous step, we understand how to find square roots of perfect squares.\\n2. **Calculation Process:**\\n   To find \\\\(\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{16}{169}}\\\\), we can use the property that the square root of a fraction is the fraction of the square roots:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{16}{169}} = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{16}}{\\\\sqrt{169}}\\n   \\\\]\\n   We know that both 16 and 169 are perfect squares.\\n3. **Result:**\\n   \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{16}}{\\\\sqrt{169}} = \\\\frac{4}{13}\\\\) because \\\\(\\\\sqrt{16} = 4\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\sqrt{169} = 13\\\\).\\n4. **Next Step:**\\n   What does this tell us about simplifying square roots of fractions? Think about how the properties of square roots help simplify complex fractions.\\n\\n### Step Three: Calculate \\\\(\\\\sqrt{72}\\\\)\\n1. **Previous Step:**\\n   From the previous steps, we know how to simplify square roots.\\n2. **Calculation Process:**\\n   To find \\\\(\\\\sqrt{72}\\\\), we look for perfect square factors within 72. We recognize that:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\sqrt{72} = \\\\sqrt{36 \\\\times 2} = \\\\sqrt{36} \\\\times \\\\sqrt{2}\\n   \\\\]\\n   Here, 36 is a perfect square.\\n3. **Result:**\\n   \\\\(\\\\sqrt{72} = 6\\\\sqrt{2}\\\\) because \\\\(\\\\sqrt{36} = 6\\\\).\\n4. **Next Step:**\\n   So, what should we do next when faced with non-perfect square numbers? We decompose them into products of perfect squares and other numbers.\\n\\n### Step Four: Calculate \\\\(\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2 \\\\times 7}{9}}\\\\)\\n1. **Previous Step:**\\n   We have seen how to handle square roots of fractions and products.\\n2. **Calculation Process:**\\n   To find \\\\(\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2 \\\\times 7}{9}}\\\\), we use the properties of square roots for both the numerator and the denominator:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2 \\\\times 7}{9}} = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{14}}{\\\\sqrt{9}}\\n   \\\\]\\n   Here, 9 is a perfect square.\\n3. **Result:**\\n   \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{14}}{3}\\\\) because \\\\(\\\\sqrt{9} = 3\\\\).\\n4. **Next Step:**\\n   Think about how you can apply the properties of square roots to more complex fractions.\\n\\n### Step Five: Arithmetic Square Root Equal to Itself\\n1. **Previous Step:**\\n   Review the concept of square roots and perfect squares.\\n2. **Calculation Process:**\\n   We need to find numbers \\\\(x\\\\) such that \\\\(\\\\sqrt{x} = x\\\\). Squaring both sides, we get:\\n   \\\\[\\n   x = x^2\\n   \\\\]\\n   Rearranging this, we get:\\n   \\\\[\\n   x^2 - x = 0 \\\\implies x(x - 1) = 0\\n   \\\\]\\n3. **Result:**\\n   The solutions are \\\\(x = 0\\\\) or \\\\(x = 1\\\\).\\n4. **Next Step:**\\n   What does this tell us about specific numbers and their properties? It shows that only 0 and 1 have the unique property that they are equal to their own square roots.\\n\\nBy breaking down each problem and understanding the principles behind calculating square roots, we've systematically solved each part and reinforced our understanding of the concept.\", name='Explainer')]}}\n",

From \\\\(\\\\min \\\\{\\\\sqrt{31}, a\\\\} = a\\\\), we understand that \\\\(a\\\\) must be less than or equal to \\\\(\\\\sqrt{31}\\\\).

From \\\\( 4c + b = 53 \\\\):\\n\\\\[ b = 53 - 4c \\\\]\\n\\n2. Substitute \\\\( b = 53 - 4c \\\\) into \\\\( 170,000b = 1,000,000 + 1,120,000c \\\\):\\n\\\\[ 170,000(53 - 4c) = 1,000,000 + 1,120,000c \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 9,010,000 - 680,000c = 1,000,000 + 1,120,000c \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 9,010,000 - 1,000,000 = 1,120,000c + 680,000c \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 8,010,000 = 1,800,000c \\\\]\\n\\\\[ c = \\\\frac{8,010,000}{1,800,000} \\\\]\\n\\\\[ c = 4.45 \\\\]\\n\\n### Explanation Four: Find \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)\\n\\nNow, we will use the value of \\\\( c \\\\) to find \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\).\\n\\n1. Since \\\\( a = 3c \\\\):\\n\\\\[ a = 3 \\\\times 4.45 = 13.35 \\\\]\\n\\n2.

Revenue of Type B:\\n\\\\[ \\\\text{Revenue of Type B} = 170,000 \\\\times 35.2 = 5,984,000 \\\\]\\n\\n2. Revenue of Type C:\\n\\\\[ \\\\text{Revenue of Type C} = 130,000 \\\\times 4.45 = 578,500 \\\\]\\n\\n### Explanation Six: Calculate the difference in sales revenue\\n\\nFinally, we subtract the revenue of Type C from the revenue of Type B to find the difference.\\n\\n1. Difference in sales revenue:\\n\\\\[ 5,984,000 - 578,500 = 5,405,500 \\\\]\\n\\nTherefore, the sales revenue of Type C is 5,405,500 yuan less than that of Type B.\", name='Explainer')]}}\n",

Here, we start with the given inequalities and the solution set. We aim to express the inequalities in a simpler form to understand the constraints on \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\).\\n\\nb. The current step involves rewriting the given inequalities in terms of \\\\( x \\\\). This helps us identify the relationship between \\\\( x \\\\), \\\\( a \\\\), and \\\\( b \\\\). The potential difficulty is ensuring that the inequalities are correctly transformed and interpreted.\\n\\nc. Next, we need to isolate \\\\( x \\\\) in each inequality and relate them to the boundaries of the solution set \\\\( -1 < x < 1 \\\\).

The challenge lies in ensuring the transformations are correct and understanding the implications of these inequalities.\\n\\nc.

      "{'Explainer': {'messages': [HumanMessage(content='### Explanation One: Analyze the problem: Set up the equations based on given conditions.\\n\\na. No previous step, this is our starting point. We need to understand the structure of the problem and set up the equations.\\nb. The problem involves setting up two linear equations based on the given conditions. We are told that the total number of horses is 100 and their combined effort is pulling 100 tiles. We translate these conditions into two equations:\\n   1. The total number of horses: \\\\(x + y = 100\\\\).\\n   2. The pulling capacity: \\\\(3x + \\\\frac{1}{3}y = 100\\\\).\\nc. The next step involves eliminating the fraction in the second equation to simplify our calculations. Think about how we can do that effectively.\\n\\n### Explanation Two: Simplify the second equation: Multiply by 3 to eliminate the fraction.\\n\\na. In the previous step, we set up the equations \\\\(x + y = 100\\\\) and \\\\(3x + \\\\frac{1}{3}y = 100\\\\).\\nb. To eliminate the fraction in the second equation, we multiply the entire equation by 3, resulting in: \\\\(3(3x + \\\\frac{1}{3}y) = 3 \\\\cdot 100\\\\). This simplifies to \\\\(9x + y = 300\\\\).\\nc. Now we have two simplified equations. What should we do next to find the values of \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\)?\\n\\n### Explanation Three: Solve the system of equations: Subtract the first equation from the new second equation.\\n\\na. From the previous step, we now have the equations \\\\(x + y = 100\\\\) and \\\\(9x + y = 300\\\\).\\nb. To isolate \\\\(x\\\\), we subtract the first equation from the second: \\\\((9x + y) - (x + y) = 300 - 100\\\\). This simplifies to \\\\(8x = 200\\\\), leading to \\\\(x = 25\\\\).\\nc. With \\\\(x = 25\\\\), how can we determine the value of \\\\(y\\\\)?\\n\\n### Explanation Four: Substitute to find \\\\(y\\\\): Substitute \\\\(x = 25\\\\) into the first equation.\\n\\na. From the previous step, we found that \\\\(x = 25\\\\).\\nb. We substitute \\\\(x = 25\\\\) into the first equation: \\\\(25 + y = 100\\\\). Solving for \\\\(y\\\\), we get \\\\(y = 75\\\\).\\nc. We now have the values of both variables. Think about whether these values satisfy both original equations.\\n\\n### Conclusion: Verify the solution\\n\\na. We found that \\\\(x = 25\\\\) and \\\\(y = 75\\\\).\\nb. Substituting \\\\(x = 25\\\\) and \\\\(y = 75\\\\) back into the original equations:\\n   - For \\\\(x + y = 100\\\\): \\\\(25 + 75 = 100\\\\), which is correct.\\n   - For \\\\(3x + \\\\frac{1}{3}y = 100\\\\): \\\\(3(25) + \\\\frac{1}{3}(75) = 75 + 25 = 100\\\\), which is also correct.\\nc.

This is our starting point, with no previous step.\\nb. The current step involves understanding that we have two linear equations in two variables, \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\). Our goal is to find values for \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) that satisfy both equations simultaneously.\\nc. To proceed, we can use either the substitution method or the elimination method. Here, we will use the elimination method. What should we do next to eliminate one of the variables?\\n\\n### Explanation Two: Eliminate one variable: Multiply equation (2) by 2\\n\\\\[\\n2x + y = 12 \\\\quad \\\\text{(2)}\\n\\\\]\\nMultiply by 2:\\n\\\\[\\n4x + 2y = 24 \\\\quad \\\\text{(3)}\\n\\\\]\\na. From the previous step, we decided to eliminate one of the variables. We chose to eliminate \\\\(y\\\\) by making the coefficients of \\\\(y\\\\) in both equations equal.\\nb. By multiplying equation (2) by 2, we obtained equation (3) where the coefficient of \\\\(y\\\\) is \\\\(2\\\\), matching the coefficient in equation (1).\\nc. Now, we can add equations (1) and (3) to eliminate \\\\(y\\\\). Think about what the result will be when we add these two equations together.\\n\\n### Explanation Three: Add the equations: Combine equation (1) and equation (3)\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n(x - 2y) + (4x + 2y) &= 6 + 24 \\\\\\\\\\nx - 2y + 4x + 2y &= 30 \\\\\\\\\\n5x &= 30\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n\\\\]\\na. Adding equations (1) and (3) results in the cancellation of \\\\(y\\\\) since \\\\(-2y\\\\) and \\\\(2y\\\\) sum to zero.\\nb. This leaves us with a single equation in \\\\(x\\\\), specifically \\\\(5x = 30\\\\).\\nc. We can now solve for \\\\(x\\\\). What will the value of \\\\(x\\\\) be once we solve \\\\(5x = 30\\\\)?\\n\\n### Explanation Four: Solve for \\\\(x\\\\): Find the value of \\\\(x\\\\)\\n\\\\[\\nx = \\\\frac{30}{5} = 6\\n\\\\]\\na.

We substitute \\\\(x = 6\\\\) into equation (2) to solve for \\\\(y\\\\).\\nb. Simplifying the equation, we find that \\\\(y = 0\\\\).\\nc.

Let's break down the solution step-by-step to ensure everyone understands how we arrived at the final expressions.\\n\\n### Part 1: Express \\\\( y \\\\) in terms of \\\\( x \\\\)\\n\\n#### Step 1: Analyze the given equation\\nWe start with the equation:\\n\\\\[ 2x - y - 4 = 0 \\\\]\\n\\nThis is a linear equation involving two variables, \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\). Our goal is to express \\\\(y\\\\) in terms of \\\\(x\\\\).\\n\\n#### Step 2: Isolate the term involving \\\\( y \\\\)\\nTo isolate \\\\(y\\\\), we need to move the constant and the \\\\(x\\\\) term to the other side of the equation. We start by adding 4 to both sides:\\n\\\\[ 2x - y - 4 + 4 = 0 + 4 \\\\]\\nThis simplifies to:\\n\\\\[ 2x - y = 4 \\\\]\\n\\nNext, we need to isolate \\\\(y\\\\). We do this by subtracting \\\\(2x\\\\) from both sides:\\n\\\\[ 2x - y - 2x = 4 - 2x \\\\]\\nSimplifying, we get:\\n\\\\[ -y = 4 - 2x \\\\]\\n\\n#### Step 3: Solve for \\\\( y \\\\)\\nSince \\\\(y\\\\) is negative on the left side, we multiply both sides by -1 to make \\\\(y\\\\) positive:\\n\\\\[ -1 \\\\cdot (-y) = -1 \\\\cdot (4 - 2x) \\\\]\\nThis results in:\\n\\\\[ y = 2x - 4 \\\\]\\n\\nSo, the expression for \\\\(y\\\\) in terms of \\\\(x\\\\) is:\\n\\\\[ y = 2x - 4 \\\\]\\n\\n### Part 2: Express \\\\( x \\\\) in terms of \\\\( y \\\\)\\n\\n#### Step 1: Analyze the given equation\\nWe start again with the same equation:\\n\\\\[ 2x - y - 4 = 0 \\\\]\\n\\nThis time, our goal is to express \\\\(x\\\\) in terms of \\\\(y\\\\).\\n\\n#### Step 2: Isolate the term involving \\\\( x \\\\)\\nTo isolate \\\\(x\\\\), we need to move the constant and the \\\\(y\\\\) term to the other side of the equation. We start by adding 4 to both sides:\\n\\\\[ 2x - y - 4 + 4 = 0 + 4 \\\\]\\nThis simplifies to:\\n\\\\[ 2x - y = 4 \\\\]\\n\\nNext, we need to isolate \\\\(2x\\\\).

      "{'Explainer': {'messages': [HumanMessage(content='### Explanation One: Analyze the problem: Solve the system of equations\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\begin{cases}\\n2x - y = 5, \\\\\\\\\\n7x - 3y = 20.\\n\\\\end{cases}\\n\\\\]\\n\\na. This is our starting point with no previous step.\\n\\nb. The current step involves understanding the system of linear equations. We need to solve for \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) such that both equations are satisfied simultaneously.\\n\\nc. To isolate one variable, we can use the elimination method. This involves manipulating the equations so that adding or subtracting them will eliminate one variable. Think about how we can achieve this.\\n\\n### Explanation Two: Multiply the first equation to align coefficients\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{Multiply } 2x - y = 5 \\\\text{ by 3, we get: }\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\n6x - 3y = 15. \\\\quad ③\\n\\\\]\\n\\na. From the previous step, we decided to use the elimination method to isolate one variable. By multiplying the first equation by 3, we align the coefficients of \\\\(y\\\\) in both equations.\\n\\nb. The calculation here involves multiplying each term in the first equation by 3. This step ensures that the coefficients of \\\\(y\\\\) in both equations are the same, which is crucial for the elimination method.\\n\\nc. Next, we will subtract the new equation from the second original equation to eliminate \\\\(y\\\\). Think about what happens when we perform this subtraction.\\n\\n### Explanation Three: Subtract the equations to eliminate \\\\(y\\\\)\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{Subtract } ③ \\\\text{ from } ②:\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\n7x - 3y - (6x - 3y) = 20 - 15\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\nx = 5\\n\\\\]\\n\\na. From the previous step, we have \\\\(6x - 3y = 15\\\\) which we will subtract from \\\\(7x - 3y = 20\\\\).\\n\\nb. When we subtract these two equations, the \\\\(y\\\\) terms cancel out because they have the same coefficients but opposite signs in subtraction. This leaves us with \\\\(x\\\\) terms and constants to solve for \\\\(x\\\\).\\n\\nc. Now that we have \\\\(x = 5\\\\), we can substitute this value back into one of the original equations to solve for \\\\(y\\\\). Please think about which equation we should substitute into and why.\\n\\n### Explanation Four: Substitute \\\\(x = 5\\\\) to solve for \\\\(y\\\\)\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\text{Substitute } x = 5 \\\\text{ into } 2x - y = 5:\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\n2 \\\\times 5 - y = 5\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\n10 - y = 5\\n\\\\]\\n\\\\[\\ny = 5\\n\\\\]\\n\\na. From the previous step, we obtained \\\\(x = 5\\\\). Now, we substitute \\\\(x = 5\\\\) into the first equation \\\\(2x - y = 5\\\\).\\n\\nb. This calculation involves basic arithmetic: substituting \\\\(5\\\\) for \\\\(x\\\\), then solving the resulting equation to find \\\\(y\\\\). The potential difficulty here is ensuring arithmetic accuracy.\\n\\nc. With \\\\(y = 5\\\\), we have found both \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\). What does this tell us about the solution to the system of equations?\\n\\n### Explanation Five: Conclude the solution\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\begin{cases}\\nx = 5, \\\\\\\\\\ny = 5.\\n\\\\end{cases}\\n\\\\]\\n\\na. From the previous step, we found that \\\\(y = 5\\\\) after substituting \\\\(x = 5\\\\).\\n\\nb. The final step is to present the solution clearly. We have solved for both variables and verified that they satisfy both original equations.\\n\\nc. The solution to the system of equations is \\\\((x, y) = (5, 5)\\\\).

For the first point, substitute \\\\( x = -1 \\\\) and \\\\( y = 9 \\\\) into the equation:\\n\\\\[ 9 = a(-1)^2 + b(-1) + c \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 9 = a - b + c \\\\]\\n\\nb. For the second point, substitute \\\\( x = 1 \\\\) and \\\\( y = 5 \\\\) into the equation:\\n\\\\[ 5 = a(1)^2 + b(1) + c \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 5 = a + b + c \\\\]\\n\\nPlease think about how we can combine these two equations to find \\\\( a + c \\\\).\\n\\n#### Step Two: Combine the equations.\\na. Add the two equations together:\\n\\\\[ (9) + (5) = (a - b + c) + (a + b + c) \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 14 = 2a + 2c \\\\]\\n\\nb. Simplify to find \\\\( a + c \\\\):\\n\\\\[ 14 = 2(a + c) \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 7 = a + c \\\\]\\n\\nSo, what should we do next? We conclude that the value of \\\\( a + c \\\\) is 7.\\n\\nBy following these steps, we have systematically arrived at the solutions for the given problems.\", name='Explainer')]}}\n",

This is our starting point, so we need to understand the given information.\\n   b. We know that the total number of books bought by both students is 22 and that the number of books bought by student A is 1 more than twice the number of books bought by student B. This gives us the two equations: \\\\(x + y = 22\\\\) and \\\\(x = 2y + 1\\\\).\\n   c. Next, we need to solve this system of equations.

Let \\\\( x \\\\) be the selling price of calculator A and \\\\( y \\\\) be the selling price of calculator B. \\n\\na. We don't have a previous step to refer to, so we begin by interpreting the problem's conditions.\\nb. We need to translate the profit conditions into mathematical equations. The profit is the selling price minus the purchase price.\\nc. Next, we will set up the equations based on the given conditions. How can we do that?\\n\\n### Explanation Two:\\nAccording to the problem, selling 5 units of model A and 1 unit of model B gives a profit of 76 yuan. This translates to the equation:\\n\\\\[ 5(x - 30) + (y - 40) = 76 \\\\]\\n\\na. We are starting with the given condition, aiming to express it algebraically.\\nb. The challenge here is to correctly expand and simplify this equation. Expanding and simplifying, we get:\\n\\\\[ 5x - 150 + y - 40 = 76 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 5x + y - 190 = 76 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 5x + y = 266 \\\\]\\nc. With this equation simplified, we move to the second condition. How do we express the second condition mathematically?\\n\\n### Explanation Three:\\nThe problem also states that selling 6 units of model A and 3 units of model B results in a profit of 120 yuan. This can be written as:\\n\\\\[ 6(x - 30) + 3(y - 40) = 120 \\\\]\\n\\na. We now have another condition to convert into an equation.\\nb. By expanding and simplifying, we get:\\n\\\\[ 6x - 180 + 3y - 120 = 120 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 6x + 3y - 300 = 120 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 6x + 3y = 420 \\\\]\\nTo simplify further, we divide the entire equation by 3:\\n\\\\[ 2x + y = 140 \\\\]\\nc.

These equations represent the simplified conditions from the problem.\\nb. To solve for \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\), we subtract the second equation from the first:\\n\\\\[ (5x + y) - (2x + y) = 266 - 140 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 3x = 126 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ x = 42 \\\\]\\nc. With \\\\( x \\\\) found, we substitute \\\\( x = 42 \\\\) back into the second equation.

Person A and Person B run at constant speeds on a circular track.\\n2. They start at the same time and place.\\n3. When running in opposite directions, they meet every 2 minutes.\\n4. When running in the same direction, they meet every 5 minutes.\\n5. Person A runs faster than Person B.\\n\\nWe need to find out how many laps each person runs per minute.\\n\\n### Explanation Two: Setting Up Equations\\n\\nTo find their speeds, let's denote:\\n- \\\\( x \\\\) as the number of laps Person A runs per minute.\\n- \\\\( y \\\\) as the number of laps Person B runs per minute.\\n\\nGiven the conditions, we can set up the following equations based on their meeting times:\\n\\n1. When they run in opposite directions, their combined speed is \\\\( x + y \\\\). They meet every 2 minutes, so in 2 minutes, they complete 1 full lap together:\\n\\\\[ 2(x + y) = 1 \\\\]\\n\\n2. When they run in the same direction, the relative speed is \\\\( x - y \\\\). They meet every 5 minutes, so in 5 minutes, they complete 1 full lap together:\\n\\\\[ 5(x - y) = 1 \\\\]\\n\\n### Explanation Three: Solving the Equations\\n\\nLet's solve these equations step by step.\\n\\n1. From the first equation:\\n\\\\[ 2(x + y) = 1 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ x + y = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\]\\n\\n2. From the second equation:\\n\\\\[ 5(x - y) = 1 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ x - y = \\\\frac{1}{5} \\\\]\\n\\n### Explanation Four: Adding the Equations\\n\\nBy adding the two equations, we can eliminate \\\\( y \\\\):\\n\\\\[ (x + y) + (x - y) = \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{5} \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 2x = \\\\frac{5}{10} + \\\\frac{2}{10} \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 2x = \\\\frac{7}{10} \\\\]\\n\\\\[ x = \\\\frac{7}{20} \\\\]\\n\\nSo, Person A runs \\\\( \\\\frac{7}{20} \\\\) laps per minute.\\n\\n### Explanation Five: Subtracting the Equations\\n\\nNow, let's subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \\\\( x \\\\):\\n\\\\[ (x + y) - (x - y) = \\\\frac{1}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{5} \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 2y = \\\\frac{5}{10} - \\\\frac{2}{10} \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 2y = \\\\frac{3}{10} \\\\]\\n\\\\[ y = \\\\frac{3}{20} \\\\]\\n\\nSo, Person B runs \\\\( \\\\frac{3}{20} \\\\) laps per minute.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nTo summarize, Person A runs \\\\( \\\\frac{7}{20} \\\\) laps per minute, and Person B runs \\\\( \\\\frac{3}{20} \\\\) laps per minute.

      "{'Explainer': {'messages': [HumanMessage(content='### Explanation One: Setting up the initial equations\\n\\n1. We start by defining the variables for the unit prices of products A and B before the discount. Let \\\\( x \\\\) be the unit price of product A in yuan, and \\\\( y \\\\) be the unit price of product B in yuan. \\n\\n2. According to the given problem, buying 60 items of product A and 30 items of product B costs 1080 yuan. This gives us the equation:\\n   \\\\[\\n   60x + 30y = 1080\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n3. Similarly, buying 50 items of product A and 10 items of product B costs 840 yuan. This provides another equation:\\n   \\\\[\\n   50x + 10y = 840\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n4. Now, we have a system of linear equations:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\begin{cases} \\n   60x + 30y = 1080, \\\\\\\\\\n   50x + 10y = 840.\\n   \\\\end{cases} \\n   \\\\]\\n\\n5. Please think about how we can simplify these equations to make them easier to solve.\\n\\n### Explanation Two: Simplifying the equations\\n\\n1. To simplify, we divide the first equation by 30:\\n   \\\\[\\n   2x + y = 36\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n2. Next, we divide the second equation by 10:\\n   \\\\[\\n   5x + y = 84\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n3. So, we now have the simplified system of equations:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\begin{cases} \\n   2x + y = 36, \\\\\\\\\\n   5x + y = 84.\\n   \\\\end{cases} \\n   \\\\]\\n\\n4. What does this tell us? It indicates that we can eliminate one of the variables by subtraction to solve for the other.\\n\\n### Explanation Three: Solving for \\\\( x \\\\)\\n\\n1. Subtract the first simplified equation from the second:\\n   \\\\[\\n   (5x + y) - (2x + y) = 84 - 36 \\n   \\\\]\\n\\n2. This simplifies to:\\n   \\\\[\\n   3x = 48 \\n   \\\\]\\n\\n3. Solving for \\\\( x \\\\), we divide both sides by 3:\\n   \\\\[\\n   x = 16\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n4. So, what should we do next? We need to substitute \\\\( x = 16 \\\\) back into one of the simplified equations to find \\\\( y \\\\).\\n\\n### Explanation Four: Solving for \\\\( y \\\\)\\n\\n1. Substitute \\\\( x = 16 \\\\) into the first simplified equation \\\\( 2x + y = 36 \\\\):\\n   \\\\[\\n   2(16) + y = 36 \\n   \\\\]\\n\\n2. This gives:\\n   \\\\[\\n   32 + y = 36 \\n   \\\\]\\n\\n3. Subtract 32 from both sides:\\n   \\\\[\\n   y = 4\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n4. We have found that \\\\( y = 4 \\\\). The unit prices of products A and B before the discount are 16 yuan and 4 yuan respectively.\\n\\n### Explanation Five: Calculating the total cost without the discount\\n\\n1. To find the discount rate, we first calculate the total cost without the discount. Xiaoming bought 500 items of product A and 450 items of product B. \\n\\n2. Calculate the total cost:\\n   \\\\[\\n   16 \\\\times 500 + 4 \\\\times 450 = 8000 + 1800 = 9800 \\\\text{ yuan}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n3. What does this tell us? The total cost without any discount would be 9800 yuan.\\n\\n### Explanation Six: Calculating the discount rate\\n\\n1. The actual amount paid by Xiaoming is 7840 yuan. \\n\\n2. To find the discount rate, we compare the actual amount to the total cost without the discount:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\frac{7840}{9800} = 0.8\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n3. The discount rate is therefore:\\n   \\\\[\\n   1 - 0.8 = 0.2 \\\\text{ or } 20\\\\%\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n4. So, what should we conclude? Products A and B were sold at an 80% discount, or in other words, there was a 20% discount rate.', name='Explainer')]}}\n",

      "{'Explainer': {'messages': [HumanMessage(content=\"### Explanation One: Define Variables and Set Up Initial Equation\\n\\nLet \\\\( x \\\\) be the number of children.\\n\\na. This is our starting point, with no previous step.\\nb. The current step involves defining the variable and setting up an equation based on the given conditions. The total number of apples is \\\\( 3x + 8 \\\\), as each child gets 3 apples and there are 8 left.\\nc. Next, we need to set up inequalities based on the condition where each child gets 5 apples. Think about why we must set up inequalities here?\\n\\n### Explanation Two: Set Up Inequalities Based on Problem Conditions\\n\\nIf each child gets 5 apples, the remaining apples are less than 5 but greater than 0:\\n\\\\[ 3x + 8 - 5(x - 1) < 5 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 3x + 8 - 5(x - 1) > 0 \\\\]\\n\\na. From the previous step, we know the total number of apples is \\\\( 3x + 8 \\\\). Now, we are considering a situation where each child gets 5 apples, but the last child gets fewer than 5.\\nb. We subtract \\\\( 5(x - 1) \\\\) because \\\\( x - 1 \\\\) children get 5 apples each, leaving fewer than 5 apples for the last child. Simplifying these inequalities might be challenging as it involves combining like terms.\\nc. Let's simplify these inequalities. What does simplifying the inequalities involve?\\n\\n### Explanation Three: Simplify Inequalities\\n\\nSimplify the first inequality:\\n\\\\[ 3x + 8 - 5(x - 1) < 5 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 3x + 8 - 5x + 5 < 5 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ -2x + 13 < 5 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ -2x < -8 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ x > 4 \\\\]\\n\\nSimplify the second inequality:\\n\\\\[ 3x + 8 - 5(x - 1) > 0 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 3x + 8 - 5x + 5 > 0 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ -2x + 13 > 0 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ -2x > -13 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ x < 6.5 \\\\]\\n\\na. We have simplified the inequalities from the previous step to obtain \\\\( x > 4 \\\\) and \\\\( x < 6.5 \\\\).\\nb. Simplifying the inequalities involves combining like terms and isolating \\\\( x \\\\). This helps us understand the range within which \\\\( x \\\\) must lie. \\nc. What does this tell us about the possible values of \\\\( x \\\\)?\\n\\n### Explanation Four: Combine Results and Determine Integer Values\\n\\nFrom the inequalities, we get:\\n\\\\[ 4 < x < 6.5 \\\\]\\n\\nSince \\\\( x \\\\) is an integer, we obtain:\\n\\\\[ x = 5 \\\\text{ or } x = 6 \\\\]\\n\\na. From the previous step, we determined that \\\\( x \\\\) must lie between 4 and 6.5.\\nb. Since \\\\( x \\\\) has to be an integer, the possible values of \\\\( x \\\\) are 5 or 6.\\nc. Next, let's calculate the total number of apples for each case. How do we do that?\\n\\n### Explanation Five: Calculate Total Apples for Each Case\\n\\nWhen \\\\( x = 5 \\\\):\\n\\\\[ 3x + 8 = 3 \\\\times 5 + 8 = 15 + 8 = 23 \\\\]\\n\\nWhen \\\\( x = 6 \\\\):\\n\\\\[ 3x + 8 = 3 \\\\times 6 + 8 = 18 + 8 = 26 \\\\]\\n\\na. From the previous step, we identified that \\\\( x \\\\) can be either 5 or 6.\\nb. To find the total number of apples, we substitute \\\\( x \\\\) with each value and calculate \\\\( 3x + 8 \\\\). This step is straightforward arithmetic.\\nc. So, what does this tell us? It tells us that there are two possible solutions: either there are 5 children and 23 apples or 6 children and 26 apples.\", name='Explainer')]}}\n",

We need to determine how many tons of loquats one Type-A vehicle and one Type-B vehicle can transport in one trip.\\n2. Let's denote the tons transported by one Type-A vehicle as \\\\(x\\\\) and by one Type-B vehicle as \\\\(y\\\\).\\n\\nAccording to the problem, we have the following system of linear equations:\\n\\\\[ \\\\begin{cases} \\n2x + 3y = 12 \\\\\\\\\\n3x + 4y = 17 \\n\\\\end{cases} \\\\]\\n\\nThis is our starting point, with no previous step. The current step involves setting up the equations based on the given conditions. Next, we need to solve this system of equations to find the values of \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\). Think about how we can simplify and solve these equations using an appropriate method.\\n\\n### Explanation Two: Using the elimination method to solve the equations\\nTo solve this system of equations, we can use the elimination method. The elimination method involves manipulating the equations to eliminate one of the variables. Here's how we proceed:\\n\\n1. Multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of \\\\(x\\\\) the same:\\n\\\\[ \\\\begin{cases} \\n6x + 9y = 36 \\\\quad \\\\text{(from } 3 \\\\times (2x + 3y = 12)) \\\\\\\\\\n6x + 8y = 34 \\\\quad \\\\text{(from } 2 \\\\times (3x + 4y = 17)) \\n\\\\end{cases} \\\\]\\n\\nBased on our setup, we know that we need to eliminate one variable by combining the equations. So, what should we do next?\\n\\n### Explanation Three: Eliminating one of the variables\\nWe subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \\\\(x\\\\):\\n\\\\[ (6x + 9y) - (6x + 8y) = 36 - 34 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 6x + 9y - 6x - 8y = 2 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ y = 2 \\\\]\\n\\nFrom the previous step, we have eliminated \\\\(x\\\\) and found \\\\(y = 2\\\\). Now, we need to find \\\\(x\\\\) by substituting \\\\(y = 2\\\\) back into one of the original equations. What does this tell us?\\n\\n### Explanation Four: Finding the value of \\\\(x\\\\)\\nSubstitute \\\\(y = 2\\\\) into the first original equation \\\\(2x + 3y = 12\\\\):\\n\\\\[ 2x + 3(2) = 12 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 2x + 6 = 12 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 2x = 6 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ x = 3 \\\\]\\n\\nSo, one Type-A vehicle can transport 3 tons, and one Type-B vehicle can transport 2 tons of loquats per trip. We have now found the values of both \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\). Think about how these results fit with the problem requirements and what this means in practical terms.\\n\\n### Conclusion: Final Answer\\nTherefore, one Type-A vehicle can transport 3 tons, and one Type-B vehicle can transport 2 tons of loquats per trip. This solution satisfies the given conditions and completes our problem-solving process.\", name='Explainer')]}}\n",

      "{'Explainer': {'messages': [HumanMessage(content=\"### Explanation One: Calculate the distance traveled to the trip base\\n\\nLet's start by determining the distance the student traveled to reach the study trip base. Given the speed and time, we can calculate the distance:\\n\\n1. First, we recognize that the speed to the trip base is 75 km/h and the time taken is 2 hours.\\n2. The formula for distance is:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\text{Distance} = \\\\text{Speed} \\\\times \\\\text{Time}\\n   \\\\]\\n   So, we plug in the given values:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\text{Distance} = 75 \\\\, \\\\text{km/h} \\\\times 2 \\\\, \\\\text{hours} = 150 \\\\, \\\\text{km}\\n   \\\\]\\n3. This tells us that the distance between the school and the study trip base is 150 km.\\n\\nNow that we have the distance, what should we do next?\\n\\n### Explanation Two: Set up inequalities for the return trip time\\n\\nNext, we need to determine the range of time required for the return trip. Since we know the distance and the range of speeds, we can set up inequalities:\\n\\n1. Let \\\\( t \\\\) be the time required for the car to return to school.\\n2. The speed on the return trip is given to be between 50 km/h and 60 km/h. So, we have:\\n   \\\\[\\n   50 \\\\, \\\\text{km/h} \\\\leq \\\\text{Speed}_{\\\\text{return}} \\\\leq 60 \\\\, \\\\text{km/h}\\n   \\\\]\\n3. Using the relationship between speed, distance, and time (\\\\(\\\\text{Speed} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Distance}}{\\\\text{Time}}\\\\)), we can form the following inequalities:\\n   \\\\[\\n   50t \\\\leq 150 \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad 60t \\\\geq 150\\n   \\\\]\\n4. This tells us that we need to solve these inequalities to find the range of \\\\( t \\\\).\\n\\nSo, what should we do next?\\n\\n### Explanation Three: Solve the inequalities to find the range of time\\n\\nLet's solve the inequalities step by step:\\n\\n1. For the first inequality, \\\\( 50t \\\\leq 150 \\\\):\\n   \\\\[\\n   t \\\\leq \\\\frac{150}{50} \\\\implies t \\\\leq 3 \\\\, \\\\text{hours}\\n   \\\\]\\n2. For the second inequality, \\\\( 60t \\\\geq 150 \\\\):\\n   \\\\[\\n   t \\\\geq \\\\frac{150}{60} \\\\implies t \\\\geq 2.5 \\\\, \\\\text{hours}\\n   \\\\]\\n3. Combining these results, we get:\\n   \\\\[\\n   2.5 \\\\leq t \\\\leq 3\\n   \\\\]\\n\\nThis tells us that the time required for the car to return to school is no less than 2.5 hours and no more than 3 hours.\\n\\nThink about what this result means in practical terms for the student's travel plan.\", name='Explainer')]}}\n",

      "{'Explainer': {'messages': [HumanMessage(content='### Explanation One: Setting Up the Problem\\n1. We need to determine how many sheets of white iron will be used to make the bodies and bottoms of cans.\\n   - Let \\\\( x \\\\) be the number of sheets used to make bodies.\\n   - Let \\\\( y \\\\) be the number of sheets used to make bottoms.\\n2. According to the problem, we have two key constraints:\\n   \\\\[\\n   x + y = 36, \\n   \\\\]\\n   and \\n   \\\\[\\n   2 \\\\times 25x = 40y.\\n   \\\\]\\n   - The first equation represents the total number of sheets.\\n   - The second equation ensures that the number of bodies and bottoms produced match perfectly according to the needs of each can.\\n\\n### Explanation Two: Simplifying the Second Equation\\n1. From the second equation:\\n   \\\\[\\n   2 \\\\times 25x = 40y.\\n   \\\\]\\n   - This equation ensures that the number of bodies and bottoms are proportionate.\\n2. Simplify the equation by combining terms:\\n   \\\\[\\n   50x = 40y.\\n   \\\\]\\n3. Divide both sides by 10 to simplify further:\\n   \\\\[\\n   5x = 4y.\\n   \\\\]\\n   - This simplifies the relationship between \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\).\\n\\n### Explanation Three: Expressing \\\\( y \\\\) in Terms of \\\\( x \\\\)\\n1. From the simplified equation \\\\( 5x = 4y \\\\):\\n   \\\\[\\n   y = \\\\frac{5}{4}x.\\n   \\\\]\\n   - This expresses \\\\( y \\\\) in terms of \\\\( x \\\\), making it easier to substitute into the first equation.\\n\\n### Explanation Four: Substituting into the First Equation\\n1. Substitute \\\\( y = \\\\frac{5}{4}x \\\\) into the first equation \\\\( x + y = 36 \\\\):\\n   \\\\[\\n   x + \\\\frac{5}{4}x = 36.\\n   \\\\]\\n2. Combine the terms on the left-hand side:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\frac{4}{4}x + \\\\frac{5}{4}x = 36 \\\\implies \\\\frac{9}{4}x = 36.\\n   \\\\]\\n   - This combines the \\\\( x \\\\) terms into a single fraction.\\n\\n### Explanation Five: Solving for \\\\( x \\\\)\\n1. Solve for \\\\( x \\\\) by isolating it:\\n   \\\\[\\n   x = 36 \\\\times \\\\frac{4}{9}.\\n   \\\\]\\n2. Perform the multiplication:\\n   \\\\[\\n   x = 16.\\n   \\\\]\\n   - This gives us the number of sheets used to make bodies.\\n\\n### Explanation Six: Solving for \\\\( y \\\\)\\n1.

By setting up the correct equations based on the problem description and solving them step-by-step, we can find the required values accurately.\", name='Explainer')]}}\n",

This is our starting point with no previous step.\\nb. The current step involves understanding the basic structure of the system of equations and recognizing we need to use the elimination method.\\nc. The next step is to eliminate one of the variables by combining the equations. Please think about how we can manipulate these equations to eliminate either \\\\(x\\\\) or \\\\(y\\\\).\\n\\n### Explanation Two: Multiplying Equation ②\\nWe choose to eliminate \\\\(x\\\\) by manipulating the equations. We can achieve this by making the coefficients of \\\\(x\\\\) in both equations the same.\\n\\na. To eliminate \\\\(x\\\\), we multiply equation ② by 4 to align with the coefficient of \\\\(x\\\\) in equation ①.\\nb. This operation results in the equation \\\\(4x - 8y = 16\\\\) from equation ②. This is now equation ③.\\nc. Next, we will subtract equation ③ from equation ① to eliminate \\\\(x\\\\). What does this tell us about the next step?\\n\\n### Explanation Three: Subtracting Equation ③ from Equation ①\\nNow we subtract equation ③ from equation ①:\\n\\n\\\\[ (4x + 3y) - (4x - 8y) = 5 - 16 \\\\]\\n\\na. From the previous step, we know that we have the equations \\\\(4x + 3y = 5\\\\) and \\\\(4x - 8y = 16\\\\).\\nb. Performing the subtraction results in the equation \\\\(11y = -11\\\\), which simplifies to \\\\(y = -1\\\\).\\nc. With \\\\(y\\\\) found, we substitute \\\\(y = -1\\\\) back into one of the original equations to find \\\\(x\\\\). So, what should we do next?\\n\\n### Explanation Four: Substituting \\\\(y = -1\\\\) Back into Equation ②\\nWe substitute \\\\(y = -1\\\\) into equation ②:\\n\\n\\\\[ x - 2(-1) = 4 \\\\]\\n\\na. From the previous step, we have \\\\(y = -1\\\\).\\nb. Substituting \\\\(y = -1\\\\) into equation ② gives \\\\(x + 2 = 4\\\\), which simplifies to \\\\(x = 2\\\\).\\nc. We have found \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\). Think about what this result means for the original system of equations.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nThe solution to the original system of equations is:\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\begin{cases} \\nx = 2, \\\\\\\\ \\ny = -1. \\n\\\\end{cases} \\\\]\\n\\nThis means that the pair \\\\((x, y) = (2, -1)\\\\) satisfies both of the original equations.', name='Explainer')]}}\n",

This translates to the inequality:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\frac{3x-1}{5} \\\\geq \\\\frac{1-5x}{6}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n#### Step 2: Clear the denominators\\n\\nTo eliminate the fractions, we need to clear the denominators. The denominators here are 5 and 6. The least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 6 is 30. Multiply both sides of the inequality by 30:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n30 \\\\cdot \\\\left(\\\\frac{3x-1}{5}\\\\right) \\\\geq 30 \\\\cdot \\\\left(\\\\frac{1-5x}{6}\\\\right)\\n\\\\]\\n\\n#### Step 3: Simplify the expressions\\n\\nWhen we multiply, the denominators will cancel out:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n6(3x-1) \\\\geq 5(1-5x)\\n\\\\]\\n\\n#### Step 4: Expand the expressions\\n\\nNext, we expand both sides of the inequality:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n6 \\\\cdot 3x - 6 \\\\cdot 1 \\\\geq 5 \\\\cdot 1 - 5 \\\\cdot 5x\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThis simplifies to:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n18x - 6 \\\\geq 5 - 25x\\n\\\\]\\n\\n#### Step 5: Rearrange the terms\\n\\nTo solve for \\\\(x\\\\), we need to get all the \\\\(x\\\\)-terms on one side and the constants on the other side. Start by adding \\\\(25x\\\\) to both sides:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n18x + 25x - 6 \\\\geq 5\\n\\\\]\\n\\nCombine like terms:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n43x - 6 \\\\geq 5\\n\\\\]\\n\\nNext, add 6 to both sides to isolate the term with \\\\(x\\\\):\\n\\n\\\\[\\n43x \\\\geq 11\\n\\\\]\\n\\n#### Step 6: Solve for \\\\(x\\\\)\\n\\nFinally, to isolate \\\\(x\\\\), divide both sides by 43:\\n\\n\\\\[\\nx \\\\geq \\\\frac{11}{43}\\n\\\\]\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\n\\nThe inequality \\\\(x \\\\geq \\\\frac{11}{43}\\\\) gives us the range of \\\\(x\\\\) that satisfies the original condition.

There is no previous step here; this is our starting point. \\nb. We need to understand that the inequality \\\\( ax + b > 0 \\\\) holds true for all \\\\( x \\\\) less than \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{5}\\\\). This means that at \\\\( x = \\\\frac{1}{5} \\\\), the inequality becomes an equality.\\nc. To find the relationship between \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), think about what happens when \\\\( x = \\\\frac{1}{5} \\\\).\\n\\n### Explanation Two: Determine the relationship between \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)\\na. At \\\\( x = \\\\frac{1}{5} \\\\), the inequality \\\\( ax + b > 0 \\\\) becomes \\\\( a \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{5} \\\\right) + b = 0 \\\\).\\nb. Solving for \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), we get \\\\( \\\\frac{a}{5} + b = 0 \\\\) which simplifies to \\\\( a + 5b = 0 \\\\).\\nc. So, \\\\( a = -5b \\\\). Now, let's substitute this relationship into the second inequality \\\\( bx - a < 0 \\\\).\\n\\n### Explanation Three: Solve the inequality \\\\( bx - a < 0 \\\\) with \\\\( a = -5b \\\\)\\na. Substituting \\\\( a = -5b \\\\) into \\\\( bx - a < 0 \\\\) gives us \\\\( bx - (-5b) < 0 \\\\).\\nb. This simplifies to \\\\( bx + 5b < 0 \\\\) or \\\\( b(x + 5) < 0 \\\\).\\nc. Since \\\\( b \\\\neq 0 \\\\), we can divide both sides by \\\\( b \\\\). What does this tell us about \\\\( x \\\\)?\\n\\n### Explanation Four: Determine the final solution set\\na. Dividing \\\\( b(x + 5) < 0 \\\\) by \\\\( b \\\\) gives us \\\\( x + 5 < 0 \\\\).\\nb. Solving this inequality, we get \\\\( x < -5 \\\\).\\nc. So, the solution set of \\\\( bx - a < 0 \\\\) is \\\\( x < -5 \\\\). This means the correct answer is B.\\n\\n### Summary:\\nBy understanding the relationships and performing step-by-step calculations, we deduced that the solution set for the inequality \\\\( bx - a < 0 \\\\) is \\\\( x < -5 \\\\).\", name='Explainer')]}}\n",

By defining \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), we can start to formulate the equations required to solve the problem.\\n\\n### Step Two: Formulate Equations Based on the Problem\\n2. **Formulate the equations:**\\n   - According to the problem, the total width of the rectangular land is 100 meters:\\n     \\\\[\\n     a + b = 100\\n     \\\\]\\n   - The yield ratio of crops A and B is given by the equation:\\n     \\\\[\\n     200a : 400b = 3 : 4\\n     \\\\]\\n\\n   This step involves converting the problem's conditions into mathematical equations. Understanding how to translate the problem statement into these equations is crucial for solving it.\\n\\n### Step Three: Simplify the Yield Ratio Equation\\n3. **Simplify the yield ratio equation:**\\n   - First, rewrite the ratio equation:\\n     \\\\[\\n     \\\\frac{200a}{400b} = \\\\frac{3}{4}\\n     \\\\]\\n   - Simplify the fraction:\\n     \\\\[\\n     \\\\frac{a}{2b} = \\\\frac{3}{4}\\n     \\\\]\\n   - Cross-multiply to form a linear equation:\\n     \\\\[\\n     4a = 6b\\n     \\\\]\\n   - Further simplify:\\n     \\\\[\\n     2a = 3b\\n     \\\\]\\n\\n   Simplifying the ratio equation helps us form a simpler, more manageable equation to work with. This step requires basic algebraic manipulation.\\n\\n### Step Four: Solve the System of Equations\\n4. **Solve the system of equations:**\\n   - From \\\\( 2a = 3b \\\\), solve for \\\\( a \\\\):\\n     \\\\[\\n     a = \\\\frac{3}{2}b\\n     \\\\]\\n   - Substitute \\\\( a = \\\\frac{3}{2}b \\\\) into \\\\( a + b = 100 \\\\):\\n     \\\\[\\n     \\\\frac{3}{2}b + b = 100\\n     \\\\]\\n   - Combine like terms:\\n     \\\\[\\n     \\\\frac{5}{2}b = 100\\n     \\\\]\\n   - Solve for \\\\( b \\\\):\\n     \\\\[\\n     b = \\\\frac{100 \\\\times 2}{5} = 40\\n     \\\\]\\n   - Substitute \\\\( b = 40 \\\\) back into \\\\( a = \\\\frac{3}{2}b \\\\):\\n     \\\\[\\n     a = \\\\frac{3}{2} \\\\times 40 = 60\\n     \\\\]\\n\\n   Solving the system of equations gives us the values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\).

From the problem, we know:\\n   - Each shaft requires 2 bearings.\\n   - Each worker processing shafts can process 15 shafts per day.\\n   - Each worker processing bearings can process 12 bearings per day.\\n   - The total number of workers is 98.\\n\\n   Thus, we can set up the following equations:\\n   \\\\[ 2 \\\\times 15x = 12y \\\\]\\n   \\\\[ x + y = 98 \\\\]\\n\\n   a.

Now, let's simplify and solve these equations. What does this tell us about the relationship between x and y?\\n\\n### Explanation Three: Simplify and Solve the Equations\\n3. Simplify the first equation:\\n   \\\\[ 30x = 12y \\\\]\\n   \\\\[ y = \\\\frac{30x}{12} = \\\\frac{5x}{2} \\\\]\\n\\n   Substitute \\\\( y = \\\\frac{5x}{2} \\\\) into the second equation:\\n   \\\\[ x + \\\\frac{5x}{2} = 98 \\\\]\\n   \\\\[ 2x + 5x = 196 \\\\]\\n   \\\\[ 7x = 196 \\\\]\\n   \\\\[ x = 28 \\\\]\\n\\n   Find \\\\( y \\\\):\\n   \\\\[ y = 98 - x \\\\]\\n   \\\\[ y = 98 - 28 \\\\]\\n   \\\\[ y = 70 \\\\]\\n\\n   a.

The key step here involves careful algebraic manipulation to isolate and solve for the variables.\\n   c. We have now found the values of \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\). So, what should we do next to ensure our solution is correct?\\n\\n### Explanation Four: Verify the Solution\\n4. Verify by substituting back into the original equations:\\n   - Check the first equation:\\n     \\\\[ 2 \\\\times 15 \\\\times 28 = 12 \\\\times 70 \\\\]\\n     \\\\[ 840 = 840 \\\\]\\n   - Check the second equation:\\n     \\\\[ 28 + 70 = 98 \\\\]\\n\\n   a.

      "{'Explainer': {'messages': [HumanMessage(content='### Explanation One: Define the Variables\\n1. Analyze the problem: We need to find the number of balls originally in Box A and Box B.\\n    a. This is our starting point, with no previous step.\\n    b. We define variables \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) to represent the number of balls in Box A and Box B, respectively.\\n    c. Now, we need to form equations based on the given conditions.\\n\\n### Explanation Two: Formulate the Equations\\n1. According to the problem: Form the first equation:\\n    a. If 10 balls are taken from Box A and placed into Box B, the number of balls in Box B becomes 6 times the number of balls in Box A.\\n    b. The equation can be written as \\\\( 6(x - 10) = y + 10 \\\\). This expresses the relationship after transferring 10 balls.\\n    c. Next, we will form the second equation. Think about the second condition given in the problem.\\n\\n2. According to the problem: Form the second equation:\\n    a. If 10 balls are taken from Box B and placed into Box A, then the number of balls in Box B is 10 more than 3 times the number of balls in Box A.\\n    b. The equation can be written as \\\\( 3(x + 10) + 10 = y - 10 \\\\). This shows how the number of balls in Box B relates to Box A after another transfer.\\n    c. Now, we have a system of two equations. What does this tell us about the next step?\\n\\n### Explanation Three: Simplify the Equations\\n1. Simplify the first equation:\\n    a. We start with \\\\( 6(x - 10) = y + 10 \\\\).\\n    b. Distribute and rearrange to get \\\\( 6x - 60 = y + 10 \\\\) and then \\\\( 6x - y = 70 \\\\).\\n    c. Next, we will simplify the second equation similarly. How should we approach it?\\n\\n2. Simplify the second equation:\\n    a. We start with \\\\( 3(x + 10) + 10 = y - 10 \\\\).\\n    b.

We now have a system of linear equations: \\\\( 6x - y = 70 \\\\) and \\\\( 3x - y = -50 \\\\). What should we do next?\\n\\n### Explanation Four: Solve the System of Equations\\n1. Solve using elimination:\\n    a. Subtract the second equation from the first: \\\\((6x - y) - (3x - y) = 70 - (-50)\\\\).\\n    b. Simplify to get \\\\( 3x = 120 \\\\), leading to \\\\( x = 40 \\\\).\\n    c. We found \\\\( x \\\\)! What does this tell us about finding \\\\( y \\\\)?\\n\\n2. Substitute \\\\( x \\\\) into one of the equations:\\n    a. Substitute \\\\( x = 40 \\\\) into \\\\( 6x - y = 70 \\\\): \\\\( 6(40) - y = 70 \\\\).\\n    b.

This solution satisfies both conditions given in the problem. So, what can we conclude from this?\\n\\n2. Conclusion:\\n    a. Box A originally had 40 balls.\\n    b.

How many tons of goods can 1 A-type truck and 1 B-type truck transport in one trip when fully loaded?\\na. This is our starting point, with no previous step.\\nb. The current step involves understanding the relationships between the trucks and the cargo they carry. We can set up two equations to represent these relationships.\\nc. The next step is to write these relationships as mathematical equations.\\n\\n### Explanation Two: Formulate the system of equations: \\nAccording to the problem:\\n\\\\[ 2x + y = 10 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ x + 2y = 11 \\\\]\\n\\na. Based on the understanding from the previous step, we now have two equations that represent the problem.\\nb. The difficulty here might be in recognizing that these are simultaneous equations and need to be solved together.\\nc. Next, we will use the elimination method to solve these equations. Please think about how we can manipulate these equations to eliminate one of the variables.\\n\\n### Explanation Three: Multiply the second equation by 2:\\n\\\\[ 2(x + 2y) = 2(11) \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 2x + 4y = 22 \\\\]\\n\\na. From the previous step, we know we need to manipulate the equations to eliminate one variable. We chose to multiply the second equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \\\\( x \\\\) in both equations.\\nb. The calculation process involves simple multiplication, which doubles each term in the second equation. This step should be straightforward but requires careful attention to ensure accuracy.\\nc. Next, we will subtract the first equation from this new equation to eliminate \\\\( x \\\\). What does this tell us about how to proceed?\\n\\n### Explanation Four: Subtract the first equation from this result:\\n\\\\[ (2x + 4y) - (2x + y) = 22 - 10 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 3y = 12 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ y = 4 \\\\]\\n\\na. By subtracting the first equation from the manipulated second equation, we eliminate \\\\( x \\\\), leaving us with an equation in terms of \\\\( y \\\\) only.\\nb. The subtraction must be done carefully to ensure each term is correctly subtracted. Here, \\\\( 2x \\\\) cancels out, and we are left with \\\\( 3y = 12 \\\\). Solving for \\\\( y \\\\) is a matter of dividing both sides by 3.\\nc. Now that we have \\\\( y = 4 \\\\), we can substitute this value back into one of the original equations to find \\\\( x \\\\). So, what should we do next?\\n\\n### Explanation Five: Substitute \\\\( y = 4 \\\\) into the first equation:\\n\\\\[ 2x + 4 = 10 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 2x = 6 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ x = 3 \\\\]\\n\\na. From the previous step, we obtained \\\\( y = 4 \\\\). We substitute this value into the first equation to solve for \\\\( x \\\\).\\nb. The substitution involves replacing \\\\( y \\\\) with 4, leading to a straightforward equation to solve for \\\\( x \\\\). By isolating \\\\( x \\\\), we find that \\\\( x = 3 \\\\).\\nc. With \\\\( x = 3 \\\\) and \\\\( y = 4 \\\\), we can now determine the total cargo capacity of one A-type truck and one B-type truck.

Importantly, it is not a question, command, or request. This foundational understanding helps us to filter out non-propositions.\\n\\n### Step Two: Analyzing Each Statement\\n\\n**Statement A: \"Draw two equal line segments.\"**\\n- **Calculation Process:** This statement is giving an instruction to draw something. Because it is an imperative sentence, it is neither true nor false.\\n- **Potential Difficulties:** Students might confuse commands with propositions because they are complete sentences.\\n- **Next Step:** Recognize that imperative sentences can\\'t be classified as true or false. So, what does this tell us about Statement A? It is not a proposition.\\n\\n**Statement B: \"Are all corresponding angles equal?\"**\\n- **Calculation Process:** This is a question, specifically an interrogative sentence. Questions are not propositions because they do not declare a fact that can be true or false.\\n- **Potential Difficulties:** Students might mistake questions for propositions if they do not remember that a proposition must be declarative.\\n- **Next Step:** Understand that interrogative sentences cannot be classified as true or false. What should we conclude about Statement B? It is not a proposition.\\n\\n**Statement C: \"Extend line segment AB to point C, so that BC = BA.\"**\\n- **Calculation Process:** This is another imperative sentence instructing someone to extend a line segment. Like Statement A, it is a command and thus not a proposition.\\n- **Potential Difficulties:** Commands can sometimes seem factual if they include conditions or results, but they are still not propositions.\\n- **Next Step:** Commands can\\'t be classified as true or false. What does this tell us about Statement C? It is not a proposition.\\n\\n**Statement D: \"Equal angles are vertical angles.\"**\\n- **Calculation Process:** This statement is declarative, making a factual assertion about angles. This type of sentence can be evaluated for truthfulness.\\n- **Potential Difficulties:** Identifying declarative sentences as propositions can be straightforward if students focus on whether the statement makes an assertion that can be true or false.\\n- **Next Step:** Since declarative sentences can be classified as true or false, what does this mean for Statement D? It is a proposition.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nBy systematically analyzing each statement, we can confirm that only Statement D is a proposition because it is the only declarative sentence that can be evaluated as true or false. Thus, the correct answer is D.', name='Explainer')]}}\n",

This is our starting point, with no previous step.\\nb. The current step involves distributing \\\\( a \\\\) over \\\\( (x-1) \\\\).

From the previous step, we've expanded the terms. Now, we must group the \\\\( x \\\\) terms on one side and the constant terms on the other.\\nb. We subtract \\\\( x \\\\) from both sides and combine the constant terms \\\\( -a \\\\) and \\\\( -2a \\\\). This can be challenging as it requires careful handling of signs and combining like terms.\\nc. After rearranging, we get \\\\( (a - 1)x > 1 - a \\\\).

We've rearranged the inequality to \\\\( (a - 1)x > 1 - a \\\\). Now, substituting \\\\( x < -1 \\\\) into the inequality helps us understand the behavior of \\\\( a \\\\).\\nb. By substituting \\\\( x = -1 \\\\), we simplify the expression to \\\\( -a + 1 > 1 - a \\\\). This indicates the inequality must hold for all \\\\( x < -1 \\\\).

From the previous step, we know that we need to simplify the expression \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{3} - \\\\frac{3 - 4}{3}\\\\).\\nb.

       "  {'Explainer': {'messages': [HumanMessage(content='### Explanation One: Analyze the problem: We need to determine how to allocate 96 people between digging and transporting soil.\\n\\na. This is our starting point, with no previous step. \\n\\nb. The problem gives us two key pieces of information: the total number of people (96) and the rates at which they can dig or transport soil. We need to set up equations based on these facts.\\n\\nc. To proceed, we need to set up the equations that describe the relationships given in the problem. Think about how we can represent the total number of people and the balance of soil being dug and transported?\\n\\n### Explanation Two: Setting up the equations: Let \\\\( x \\\\) be the number of people digging and \\\\( y \\\\) be the number of people transporting.\\n\\na. We need to represent the total number of people and the balance of soil being dug and transported as equations. From the problem, we get:\\n\\\\[ x + y = 96 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 5x = 3y \\\\]\\n\\nb. The first equation \\\\( x + y = 96 \\\\) simply states that the total number of people is 96. The second equation \\\\( 5x = 3y \\\\) ensures that the amount of soil dug (5 m³ per person) equals the amount of soil transported (3 m³ per person).\\n\\nc. To solve these equations, we need to express one variable in terms of the other. What would be a good next step to isolate \\\\( y \\\\) or \\\\( x \\\\) in one of these equations?\\n\\n### Explanation Three: Solving for \\\\( y \\\\) in terms of \\\\( x \\\\): From \\\\( 5x = 3y \\\\), we get:\\n\\\\[ y = \\\\frac{5}{3}x \\\\]\\n\\na. By isolating \\\\( y \\\\), we have expressed one variable in terms of the other which simplifies our system of equations.\\n\\nb. This step involves basic algebraic manipulation. We divide both sides of the equation \\\\( 5x = 3y \\\\) by 3 to isolate \\\\( y \\\\). This can sometimes be tricky if you’re not familiar with fractions.\\n\\nc. With \\\\( y \\\\) expressed in terms of \\\\( x \\\\), we can substitute this into the first equation \\\\( x + y = 96 \\\\). How can we use this substitution to solve for \\\\( x \\\\)?\\n\\n### Explanation Four: Substituting \\\\( y \\\\) in \\\\( x + y = 96 \\\\):\\n\\\\[ x + \\\\frac{5}{3}x = 96 \\\\]\\n\\na. We substitute \\\\( y = \\\\frac{5}{3}x \\\\) into \\\\( x + y = 96 \\\\).\\n\\nb. The equation now becomes \\\\( x + \\\\frac{5}{3}x = 96 \\\\). Combining like terms on the left side, we get \\\\( \\\\frac{8}{3}x = 96 \\\\).\\n\\nc. To find \\\\( x \\\\), we can solve this equation by multiplying both sides by 3/8. What do we get when we solve for \\\\( x \\\\)?\\n\\n### Explanation Five: Solving for \\\\( x \\\\):\\n\\\\[ \\\\frac{8}{3}x = 96 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ x = 96 \\\\times \\\\frac{3}{8} \\\\]\\n\\\\[ x = 36 \\\\]\\n\\na. By solving \\\\( \\\\frac{8}{3}x = 96 \\\\), we find that \\\\( x = 36 \\\\).\\n\\nb. This calculation involves multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of \\\\(\\\\frac{8}{3}\\\\), which is a straightforward algebraic operation.\\n\\nc. Now that we have \\\\( x = 36 \\\\), we can find \\\\( y \\\\) using the first equation \\\\( x + y = 96 \\\\). What is \\\\( y \\\\) when \\\\( x = 36 \\\\)?\\n\\n### Explanation Six: Finding \\\\( y \\\\):\\n\\\\[ y = 96 - x \\\\]\\n\\\\[ y = 96 - 36 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ y = 60 \\\\]\\n\\na. By substituting \\\\( x = 36 \\\\) into \\\\( x + y = 96 \\\\), we find \\\\( y = 60 \\\\).\\n\\nb. This step involves simple subtraction to find the remaining number of people allocated to transporting soil.\\n\\nc. We now have \\\\( x = 36 \\\\) and \\\\( y = 60 \\\\). What does this tell us about our solution?\\n\\n### Explanation Seven: Conclusion\\nWe have determined that assigning 36 people to digging and 60 people to transporting soil ensures that the dug soil can be transported away just in time.

From the previous step, we know that by multiplying both sides by 3, we eliminate the fractions.\\nb. We now have a linear equation. To isolate the variable \\\\(x\\\\), we need to move all terms involving \\\\(x\\\\) to one side of the equation and the constants to the other.\\nc. So, what should we do next? We should add \\\\(x\\\\) to both sides to start isolating \\\\(x\\\\).\\n\\n### Explanation Three:\\nAdding \\\\(x\\\\) to both sides gives us:\\n\\\\[\\n2x + x - m = 2\\n\\\\]\\n\\na.

From the previous step, we learned how to deal with square roots and fractions. Now, we apply this to \\\\(\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2 \\\\times 7}{9}}\\\\).\\n2. We need to simplify \\\\(\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2 \\\\times 7}{9}}\\\\). This can be written as \\\\(\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{14}{9}}\\\\). Using the property of square roots for fractions, we get \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{14}}{\\\\sqrt{9}} = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{14}}{3}\\\\).\\n3. This gives us \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{14}}{3}\\\\). Now, let's move to the final problem.\\n\\n### Explanation Five: Determine the numbers whose arithmetic square roots are equal to themselves.\\n1. The problem asks us to find numbers whose square roots are equal to the numbers themselves.\\n2. Let’s denote such a number by \\\\(x\\\\). The condition given in the problem is \\\\(\\\\sqrt{x} = x\\\\). Squaring both sides, we get \\\\(x^2 = x\\\\).\\n3. Solving this equation, we get \\\\(x(x - 1) = 0\\\\), which means \\\\(x = 0\\\\) or \\\\(x = 1\\\\). Therefore, the numbers are 0 and 1.\", name='Explainer')]}},\n",

      "a. 我们通过减去 \\(x\\) 将不等式右侧的 \\(x\\) 项移到左侧。\n",

      "#### 第五步：解 \\(x\\)\n",
      "两边加1：\n",
      "\\[x < 3\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 第六步：确定非负整数解\n",
      "非负整数解为 \\(x = 0, 1, 2\\)。\n",

      "让我们逐步分解这个问题和我们的方法，以确保对我们如何得出解决方案有一个透彻的理解。\n",
      "\n",
      "### 第一步：分析问题\n",
      "问题给了我们一个不等式系统：\n",
      "\\[\n",
      "\\left\\{\n",
      "\\begin{array}{l}\n",
      "x > a \\\\\n",
      "x \\geq 1\n",
      "\\end{array}\n",
      "\\right.\n",
      "\\]\n",
      "并要求我们找到 \\(a\\) 的取值范围，使得解集为 \\(x \\geq 1\\)。\n",
      "\n",
      "单独考虑每个不等式的含义。第一个不等式 \\(x > a\\) 要求 \\(x\\) 大于 \\(a\\)。第二个不等式 \\(x \\geq 1\\) 要求 \\(x\\) 至少为1。\n",
      "\n",
      "这告诉了我们什么？\n",
      "\n",
      "### 第二步：合并条件\n",
      "为了找到合并后的解集，我们需要理解这些不等式如何相互作用。对于系统的解集是 \\(x \\geq 1\\)，不等式 \\(x > a\\) 不得限制 \\(x\\) 小于1。这意味着 \\(a\\) 必须小于或等于1，但不等于1，因为 \\(x > a\\) 会排除 \\(x = 1\\)。\n",
      "\n",
      "那么，接下来我们应该做什么？\n",
      "\n",
      "### 第三步：找到 \\(a\\) 的取值范围\n",
      "我们需要形式化 \\(a\\) 的条件。我们知道 \\(x > a\\) 和 \\(x \\geq 1\\) 都必须为真。如果 \\(a \\geq 1\\)，那么 \\(x > a\\) 不一定包括 \\(x \\geq 1\\)。但是，如果 \\(a < 1\\)，那么 \\(x > a\\) 将总是包括 \\(x \\geq 1\\)。\n",
      "\n",
      "因此，\\(a\\) 必须严格小于1，使得 \\(x \\geq 1\\) 是系统的解集。\n",
      "\n",
      "### 结论\n",
      "分析确认，\\(x\\) 的解集为 \\(x \\geq 1\\) 需要 \\(a < 1\\)。因此，适当的答案是：\n",
      "\\[\n",
      "\\boxed{a < 1}\n",
      "\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "这种逐步的方法确保我们理解不等式之间的相互作用及其如何影响 \\(a\\) 的取值。\n",

How many tons of goods can 1 A-type truck and 1 B-type truck transport in one trip when fully loaded?\n",
      "a. 这是我们的起点，没有前一步骤。\n",
      "b. 当前步骤涉及理解卡车与货物之间的关系。我们可以建立两个方程来表示这些关系。\n",
      "c. 下一步是将这些关系写成数学方程。\n",

      "\\[ 2x + y = 10 \\]\n",
      "\\[ x + 2y = 11 \\]\n",

      "a. 根据前一步的理解，我们现在有两个表示问题的方程。\n",
      "b. 这里的难点可能在于认识到这些是联立方程，需要一起求解。\n",
      "c. 接下来，我们将使用消元法来解这些方程。请思考我们如何操作这些方程来消去一个变量。\n",
      "\n",
      "### Explanation Three: Multiply the second equation by 2:\n",
      "\\[ 2(x + 2y) = 2(11) \\]\n",
      "\\[ 2x + 4y = 22 \\]\n",
      "\n",
      "a. 从上一步骤中，我们知道需要操作方程以消去一个变量。我们选择将第二个方程乘以2，以对齐两个方程中 \\( x \\) 的系数。\n",
      "b. 计算过程涉及简单的乘法，将第二个方程的每一项都加倍。这一步应该很简单，但需要仔细以确保准确。\n",
      "c. 接下来，我们将从这个新方程中减去第一个方程，以消去 \\( x \\)。这告诉我们如何进行下一步？\n",
      "\n",
      "### Explanation Four: Subtract the first equation from this result:\n",
      "\\[ (2x + 4y) - (2x + y) = 22 - 10 \\]\n",
      "\\[ 3y = 12 \\]\n",
      "\\[ y = 4 \\]\n",
      "\n",
      "a. 通过从操作过的第二个方程中减去第一个方程，我们消除了 \\( x \\)，只剩下一个关于 \\( y \\) 的方程。\n",
      "b. 减法必须小心操作，以确保每一项都正确相减。这里，\\( 2x \\) 抵消了，我们剩下 \\( 3y = 12 \\)。解 \\( y \\) 就是将两边都除以3。\n",
      "c. 现在我们有了 \\( y = 4 \\)，我们可以将这个值代入原方程之一来求 \\( x \\)。那么我们接下来应该做什么？\n",

      "\\[ 2x = 6 \\]\n",
      "\\[ x = 3 \\]\n",
      "\n",
      "a. 从上一步，我们得到了 \\( y = 4 \\)。我们将这个值代入第一个方程以求 \\( x \\)。\n",
      "b. 代入涉及将 \\( y \\) 替换为4，得到一个简单的方程来求 \\( x \\)。通过将 \\( x \\) 分离，我们得到 \\( x = 3 \\)。\n",
      "c. 有了 \\( x = 3 \\) 和 \\( y = 4 \\)，我们现在可以确定一辆A型卡车和一辆B型卡车的总货运能力。这告诉我们什么关于合并载荷？\n",
      "\n",
      "### Explanation Six: Calculate the combined load:\n",
      "\\[ x + y = 3 + 4 = 7 \\]\n",
      "\n",
      "a. 我们之前找到了 \\( x = 3 \\) 和 \\( y = 4 \\)。\n",
      "b. 将这些值相加，得到一辆A型卡车和一辆B型卡车的总货运能力，即7吨。\n",
      "c. 这个结果告诉我们，一辆A型卡车和一辆B型卡车在满载时可以一起运输7吨货物。\n",

      "### 第一步：理解命题\n",

      "- **可能的困难：** 学生可能会将命令混淆为命题，因为它们是完整的句子。\n",
      "- **下一步：** 认识到祈使句不能被归类为真或假。那么，这告诉我们关于陈述A什么呢？它不是一个命题。\n",
      "\n",
      "**陈述B：“所有对应角都相等吗？”**\n",
      "- **计算过程：** 这是一个问题，具体来说是一个疑问句。问题不是命题，因为它们没有声明一个可以被评估为真或假的事实。\n",
      "- **可能的困难：** 如果学生不记得命题必须是陈述句，他们可能会将问题误认为是命题。\n",
      "- **下一步：** 理解疑问句不能被归类为真或假。我们应该得出关于陈述B什么结论？它不是一个命题。\n",
      "\n",
      "**陈述C：“将线段AB延长到点C，使BC = BA。”**\n",
      "- **计算过程：** 这是另一个祈使句，指示某人延长一条线段。像陈述A一样，它是一个命令，因此不是一个命题。\n",
      "- **可能的困难：** 命令有时看起来像事实，如果它们包含条件或结果，但它们仍然不是命题。\n",
      "- **下一步：** 命令不能被归类为真或假。那么，这告诉我们关于陈述C什么呢？它不是一个命题。\n",
      "\n",
      "**陈述D：“相等的角是对顶角。”**\n",
      "- **计算过程：** 这个陈述是陈述句，对角度做出一个事实性声明。这种类型的句子可以被评估为真或假。\n",
      "- **可能的困难：** 如果学生专注于陈述是否做出了可以被评估为真或假的断言，识别陈述句作为命题可能是直接的。\n",
      "- **下一步：** 由于陈述句可以被归类为真或假，这对陈述D意味着什么？它是一个命题。\n",
      "\n",
